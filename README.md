# Customer Lifetime Prediction Project
This repository contains code and resources for the Customer Lifetime Prediction project. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the lifetime value of customers for an auto insurance company. By accurately predicting customer lifetime value, the company can make informed decisions regarding customer acquisition, retention, and marketing strategies.

# Features
-> Utilizes machine learning algorithms like Decesion Tree and Random Forest  to build the predictive model.

-> Performs data preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and data normalization.

-> Evaluates the model's performance using various metrics such as MSE and RMSE.

-> Includes data visualization techniques to gain insights from the data and interpret the model's predictions.

-> Provides Jupyter Notebook files with detailed explanations and code documentation for better understanding and reproducibility.
# Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing historical customer information, including demographics, policy details, claims history, and customer tenure. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

# Usage
-> Open the Jupyter Notebook files to explore the code and run the cells step-by-step.

-> Follow the instructions provided in the notebooks for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

-> Customize the code and experiment with different algorithms or techniques to improve the model's performance.
# Results
The project aims to achieve high score of 0.98% in predicting customer lifetime value. The performance of the models can be evaluated using various evaluation metrics, and the results can be visualized to gain insights into the factors influencing customer lifetime value.
